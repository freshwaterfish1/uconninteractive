title: And we're live!

The blog has been setup, the Oculus has been gotten and work has begun on the project. Head over to the updated [about](http://freshwaterfish1.github.io/uconninteractive/about/) page to get an idea of what all this is about. On a housekeeping note, it is finals week and I won't have time to update as quickly as I'd like until at least the start of this weekend. As a result, the first content post will probably be a bit larger than the rest. That’s about it for now, I’m looking forward to seeing how this project, will progress as time goes on. For now it’s all apprehension and nervous excitement.
