##Intro
This independent study plans to create an Oculus Rift experience by recreating memorable locations from the University of Connecticut in virtual reality. This will be accomplished in three main parts: the game, the blog, and the feedback. Splitting up this project into three concurrent parts allows for faster feedback, quicker iterations of the game, and better recording of the creation process.

This project will start during the 2015 Winter semester with prototyping and generalized Oculus testings, and ramp up into a full-time project at the start of the Spring 2016 semester. By the end of the semester, the interactive experience will be completed and feedback will be recorded, with all the gained knowledge reported in the ongoing blog.

##Components
###Game
The interactive experience itself is a virtual tour of four select campus locations that the player will walk through. There may be small interactions in each scene, but they will be optional .
###Blog
A blog will be created in order to record the development of the interactive experience. In regular update posts all progress, setbacks, changes, updates, and prototypes will be reported.
###Feedback
Once the first version of the working interactive experience is completed, it will be demonstrated to a as wide of a variety of people as possible. As outlined by Steve Krug in [_Rocket Surgery Made Easy_](http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Do-It-Yourself/dp/0321657292), different users approach the experience with different levels of prior knowledge. Some users may find design flaws or bugs that other users or even designers could not. These issues will be recorded on the blog, and further improvements to the experience will attempt to resolve or quell as many as possible.
